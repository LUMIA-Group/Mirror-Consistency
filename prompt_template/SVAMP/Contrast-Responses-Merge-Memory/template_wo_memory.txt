Given two candidate solutions for a question, carefully analyze and compare the differences in their reasoning steps. Consider: 1: The specific differences in their reasoning steps and final answers; 2: The reasons behind these disparities.

Question: [QUESTION]
Two solutions : 
Solution 1: [CUR-SELECTED-RESPONSE]
Solution 2: [CANDIDATE]

If no differences exist, output <STOP!>
If differences are identified, describe them, determine errors, and explain why. Extract a key suggestion to prevent such errors. Begin the suggestion with <SUGGESTION>.
